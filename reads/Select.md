#### Here's how select works:

The select statement waits until at least one of the channel operations can proceed.
If multiple channels are ready, one of them is chosen pseudo-randomly.
If no channel is ready and there is no default case, the select statement blocks
until at least one channel becomes ready.

When a channel operation is ready for communication (either sending or receiving),
the corresponding case associated with that channel is executed.
For example, if <-channel1 is ready, the code block under case <-channel1:
will be executed.

If a channel operation involves receiving a value, the value is assigned to the
designated variable. In the example above, if <-channel3 is ready, the received value
will be assigned to the message variable.

If a channel operation involves receiving a value, the value is assigned to the
designated variable. In the example above, if <-channel3 is ready, the received value
will be assigned to the message variable.

If multiple cases are ready at the same time, one is chosen randomly and executed.
This non-deterministic behavior ensures fairness and prevents any specific channel
from being starved.

If no channel operation is ready and there is a default case, the code block under
the default case is executed immediately. This is useful for handling situations when
none of the channels are ready for communication.

It's important to note that the select statement doesn't block indefinitely
if no channel is ready and there is no default case. It will continue to evaluate the
readiness of channels and proceed as soon as any channel becomes ready.

```
select {
case <-channel1:
// Handle communication on channel1
case <-channel2:
// Handle communication on channel2
case message := <-channel3:
// Handle communication on channel3 and assign received value to message variable
default:
// Handle the case when no channel is ready for communication
}

```
